# GlobalPathPlannerPlugin 
I am rewriting Path Planner Plugin for turtlebot3 using KinoDynamic A Star in ROS melodic which is the only way to change the default global path planning algorithm.

## what to do from here?
1. registering the plugin and making the respective launch file for gazebo (follow http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Writing%20A%20Global%20Path%20Planner%20As%20Plugin%20in%20ROS)
2. implementing the dwa local planner to control the velocity as per the one instructed by the algo. the required vel is changed in vstartx and vstarty by KinoDAStar() function in this plugin but we need to ensure that this velocity isactually used by local planner.
